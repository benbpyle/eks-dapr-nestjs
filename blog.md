Adaptability is a characteristic of software systems that developers and architects are always trying to obtain.  However, it's a balance between productivity, performance, maintainability, and mamany other "ilities" that sometimes force trade-offs.  One way to ehance a system's adaptability is to start with the right level of operational abstraction.  For the balance of this article, I'm mamaking the choice to start with Kubernetes, more speficially AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). This is a great start towards adaptability as I can leverage so many open source and commerical grade packages, but what if I wanted to take things a step further?  There's an architectual pattern called ports and adapters or also described as hexagonal.  No doubt that sounds more adaptable, but what does it mean and how would one achieve it? Enter Dapr.  A way to build extensible and adaptable microservice systems ready for the modern cloud to tackle the next evolution of compute.  Let's get going!
